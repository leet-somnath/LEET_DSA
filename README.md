> # DATA_STRUCTURE

---

This is the collection of dsa problems ,where i will be solving problems topic wise from 14th sep 2023

Here you can find solutions for various coding/algorithmic problems and many useful resources for learning algorithms and data structures. Also, this repo will be updated with new solutions and resources from time to time.

you may find questions repeated because i have classiffed them according to the methods i have solved,for example:= u may find a problem based on array but i solved in hashmap then i saved it in both array folder as well as hashmap folder so that we can have a better classification.But if there exists more than one solution,which i may not solved by my own ,it will be under comments,they may be really optimized from my solution.By this way u can have better understanding between brute force and optimized solution for your sake as well as mine.

Note that this repo is meant to be used for learning and researching purposes only and it is not meant to be used for production.
